# KnewClear traceability tool backend

> 

## About

The KnewClear traceability tool project was started with the intention of creating a common standard "language" for transactions of sustainably and ethically made products. While a product is usually characterized by quality/cost considerations, a set of criteria that are rapidly becoming important in today's markets are the ecological and social impact of the production process. 

The traceability tool enables buyer and supplier to systematically manage the criteria and standards for an intended transaction of products between the two parties. The framework has the flexibility to add standards from various certifying bodies such as GOTS, Fair Trade, etc., as well the transacting parties own criteria as a new set of standards for the given product.

This repository provides the backend of the product, with the frontend part hosted [here](https://github.com/abhijitrmly/client-v1).

This project is still a work in progress and will soon be updated with a list of TODOs for planning the next part of development. For any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Kenji Higashi at kenjoylife@gmail.com or Abhijit Muley at abhijitrmly@gmail.com.

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.
